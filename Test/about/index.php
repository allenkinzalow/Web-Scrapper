                    Conner, Erich, and Victor. Our name was synthesized organically using the pinnacle of our
                    synergistic creativity: a

                <p class="grey-text text-darken-2">Going along with what we knew, our first idea was to use
                    a JavaFX chat application and then go from there. Unfortunately, the api calls through java were
                    difficult and generating another html view in the application felt repetitive.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-2">
                    Since we needed to move fast we hopped over to php and got a quick chat working from CSS-Tricks.
                    Next, with a heavy reliance on materialize and provided libraries we were able to build a site that
                    wouldn't make everyone's eyes salty.
                </p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-2">
                    Since we were all fairly unfamiliar with web crawling we had to continuously limit the scope of our
                    project.
                    Our initial idea was to build a twitter analyzer that would generate a few interesting data items
                    based on a user's tweets and followers, etc. But we ended up settling on Facebook.

                    Currently, our chat bot can only pull from facebook, but eventually we'd like it to do our original
                    idea of
                    tweet analysis, along with white page listings and person suggestion. We found we hit a lot literal
                    limits with api calls, and our regex skill needed some honing.

                <p class="grey-text text-darken-2">
                    In addition to the bot features, the chat client would have to be revamped and improved heavily in
                    order to be deployable such as banning, kicking, and full fledged registration. Regardless, we
                    learned plenty and ended up with something usable!
